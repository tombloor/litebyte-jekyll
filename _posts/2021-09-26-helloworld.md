Hello, World! (Yes, we're doing this)

<!--more-->

How else would you start a new project than with some form of Hello, World! So here it is. I guess this would be as 
good a place as any to give a brief introduction to this project (my blog) and what sort of content may end up on here.

This blog is mainly going to serve as a place for me to get information out of my brain before it gets replaced by 
something useless like a catchy jingle or some abstract trivia about squirrels. I'm going to be splitting the content 
into a number of categories to help with organisation further down the line. At the time of writing this, there are a 
couple of different types of content I'm expecting to end up on here in one way or another:

- *Programming content* As an example, I've recently enjoyed working through programming challenges as a change of pace 
from the types of projects I encounter at work. I'll be documenting my thought process as I work through these problems 
in case they're of interest to anyone (or more likely, my future self). 
- *Gaming content* I'm a nerd that likes to play nerdy games which tend to lend themselves well to a writeup. 
There will likely be some crossover here with my programming content as I occasionally dabble in programming games such
as [Screeps](https://screeps.com/)
- *Other content* There will be other stuff, I don't know what it is yet, but I know it'll happen.

That pretty much covers everything I wanted to write for this post, if you happened upon this blog by some random chance
, check back now and then to see what I'm up to.
