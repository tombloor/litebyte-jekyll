Given a 6x6 2d array, find the maximum sum of all the hourglasses.

... Ok so this problem doesn't make much sense without some more context. In this post I'll walk through how I tackled
the `2D Array - DS` problem on [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com). It's a fairly straightforward one to solve,
but I wanted to ease into these write ups, so this was a good place to start.

## Preamble

I've recently been trying to dedicate some time each week working on programming challenges or personal projects.
Finding time to program outside of work can sometimes be a challenge, but I've found it refreshing to be able to sit
down for 20-30 minutes and write some code unrelated to my job. It's definitely something I want to try to do more 
often.

After I'd worked through a couple of these problems, I felt it would be a good to write them up as full walkthroughs.
At the time of writing this post I have been working professionally as a developer for around 8 years, and I can 
honestly say I've never experienced aything like many of these challenges in a real-world scenario. However they are 
still fun and interesting to work through, and they often lead to exploring new ideas and techniques that I may not be
exposed otherwise.
